Welcome to Little helper's documentation!
=========================================

Contents:

In the context of our final year project, we are working on an autonomous vehicle.
Our project is to build a car that will be able to autonomously transport food in a closed or quiet environment,
such as a hospital or a retirement home.
The hospital staff will have choices between different preloaded paths between the hospital kitchen and
the other buildings in the area, and the car will avoid collisions and going off the road.

You will find here the complete documentation of the code for the Raspberry pi part.
